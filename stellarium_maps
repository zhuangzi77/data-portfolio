  <h2>Mapping of Celestial Journeys in the Poems of Zhang Heng and Wang Yi</h2>
  <h3>Zhang Heng's Celestial Journey</h3>
    <p>I leave the solemn majesty of the Purple Palace,<br>
And arrive at the towering heights of Taiwei.<br>
I command Wang Liang to spur on the Quadriga;<br>
We cross the Towering Pavillion towering on high.<br>
I deploy the Net Carriage, its mesh broadly spread,<br>
And hunt the vast expanse of Blue Grove.<br>
Drawing the Majestic Bow, bending it full,<br>
I shoot the giant Great Wolf.<br>
I inspect the Ramparts at Northern Village,<br>
Beat the rumbling River Drum.<br>
Riding the surging swell of Fords of Heaven,<br>
I float the fluvial flow of Han in the Clouds.<br>
Leaning on the Twinkler and Conductors, I whirl and turn,<br>
And perceive the continuous coursing of Two Norms and Five Wefts...<br>

   <h3>Wang Yi's Journey</h3>
     <p>I approach Fu Yue, riding upon a dragon,<br>
Meet the Weaver Maiden and take her as my bride.<br>
I raise the Net of Heaven and capture the wayward,<br>
Draw the Bow of Heaven and shoot the treacherous.<br>
I follow the true men and soar up high,<br>
Consuming primordial qi, long I endure.<br>
I look upon Grand Tenuity so very solemn,<br>
And peer at the brilliance of the Three Stairways.....<br>
